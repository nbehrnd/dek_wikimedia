# name:  file_count.txt
#
# Per curiosity, tracking the number of Wikimedia's .svg addressses.
# The date, expressed in the format of YYYY-MM-DD, is the day when
# Wikimedia was called to list all addresses of files simultaneously
# tagged by 'SVG' and 'Deutsche Einheitskurzschrit'. Entry time, as
# in min:ss, tracks the time necessary for Wikimedia to generate the
# listing, delivered in a zip-compressed .txt file.  (Once fetched
# locally, the generation of the three helpful lists is complete in
# less than half a second each; performed right after)  Data is the
# number of addresses considered.  Column separator is the colon,
# missing entries are marked by the string 'None'.
