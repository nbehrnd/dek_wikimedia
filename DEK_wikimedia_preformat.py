"""Assistant script #4: reformat Wikimedia's list of addresses of .svg.

The 21k+ .svg files by Thirunavukkarasye-Raveendran about DEK's
Verkehrsschrift, published as public domain on Wikimedia, are tagged
with "SVG" and "Deutsche Einheitskurzschrift".  Their addresses may
be collected with these tags by the service

https://tools.wmflabs.org/wikilovesdownloads/

By default, it is a single text file, 1.txt, which is provided within
a .zip archive.

This script extracts the listing from its archive, renames the file,
and adds a brief commentary within the file to share it comfortably
on GitHub while retaining a note about its origin.

Deposit this script in the same folder containing the .zip archive
provided by Wikimedia.  From the CLI of Python, call

python DEK_wikimedia_preformat.py [archive.zip]

where [archive.zip] is the sole and mandatory parameter.  This will
write a text file named [wikimedia_addresses.txt], to reflect the
origin of the data.  Internally, this new file contains a time stamp
in the format of YYYY-MM-DD about the day when this file was written.
It is the same day the Wikimedia archive was downloaded, too.

File [wikimedia_addresses.txt] is the sole - yet mandatory - parameter
to run assistant script #5, DEK_wikimedia_lists.py."""
